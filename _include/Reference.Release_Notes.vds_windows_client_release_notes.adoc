=== Improvements

* Graceful handling of a fringe bug with the RDP protocol where legacy credential types mixed with the most current patches on a RDS gateway results in an inability to connect to session hosts
**  If the end user’s workstation is set up (whether by an external admin, internal customer admin or via the workstation’s default settings) to use legacy credential types, there is a slim possibility this could have impacted users prior to this release

=== Improvements

* Proactive enhancements to security, stability and scalability

=== Considerations

* The Cloud Workspace Client for Windows will continue to auto-update as long as a user launches it prior to 4/2.

* If your organization uses web filtering, please safelist access to cwc.cloudworkspace.com and cwc-cloud.cloudworkspace.com so that auto-update functionality remains in place

_Impact:_  Users will see the RDP client update the next time they launch it

=== Improvements

* Improved clarity for the reason a user would see a ‘your services are currently offline’ message. The potential causes for a message appearing are:

*** If the user was using the HTML5 login portal, they would see: “Your services are currently scheduled to be offline. Please contact your administrator if you need access.”
** Session host server is scheduled to be online and user does not have Wake on Demand permissions.
*** If the user was using the Cloud Workspace Client, they would see: “Your services are currently offline, please contact your administrator if you need access.”

** Session host server is scheduled to be online and user has Wake on Demand permissions.
